      "description": "Innate: Ivern cannot attack or damage non-epic monsters. Instead, targeting a jungle camp initiates a 2.5 seconds channel that, upon completion, places the monsters within a grove. Placing a grove costs  131.63 \u2212 121 (based on level) health and  148.5 \u2212 110.25 (based on level) mana, and cannot be cast if Ivern lacks the resources. The channel cannot be cancelled in the first 0.15 seconds and in the last 0.5 seconds.",
      "description2": "The grove matures over 40 \u2212 1 (based on level) seconds. When fully matured, Ivern can interact with the camp again to free the monsters after 0.5 seconds, sending them away while receiving their  full gold and  full experience bounties.  Smiting a large monster within a grove will instantly free the camp's monsters, regardless of its maturity or the monsters' current health.",
      "description3": "If the camp's large monster has already been slain, Ivern will free the camp upon completing the channel at no cost. Similarly, the grove will instantly mature if the large monster is slain.",
      "description4": "Starting at level 5, freeing the  Red Brambleback or the  Blue Sentinel leaves behind a sapling for 1 minute that can be picked up by an allied champion to gain the camp's buff, consuming it in the process. If at least one allied champion is nearby, Ivern can pick up the sapling to transfer it to the nearest one in range. If an ally kills either monster, they also leave behind a sapling that only Ivern can consume.",

Interrupting the channel or killing Ivern is the only way to contest jungle camps, short of killing the camp during the channel time.\n  If the large monster in a camp is still alive, Ivern must gain vision of it to use Friend of the Forest on that camp.\n If the large monster in a camp is still alive, Ivern will walk towards it to use Friend of the Forest. Attempting to use Friend of the Forest on the camp\u2019s smaller monster will not change the total distance that Ivern walks.\n Friend of the Forest will leave Ivern at 1 current health if cast with exactly the required amount. Friend of the Forest cannot be cast with less, unlike other abilities with health costs.\n Non-epic monsters turned hostile by an allied or an enemy champion will still attack Ivern if he is the closest target (he is not immune to monster damage) yet he still cannot return fire if so (despite not being the one turning the monsters hostile)\n  Daisy also cannot attack non-epic monsters.\n Monsters are not hurt nor do they become hostile by Ivern when he is equipped with an item that has the Immolate effect.\n In Nexus Blitz, Friend of the Forest will not affect monsters. Ivern becomes hostile with them."
