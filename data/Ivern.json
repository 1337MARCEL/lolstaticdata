Friend of the Forest cannot be cast with less, unlike other abilities with health costs.\n Non-epic monsters turned hostile by an allied or an enemy champion will still attack Ivern if he is the closest target (he is not immune to monster damage) yet he still cannot return fire if so (despite not being the one turning the monsters hostile)\n  Daisy also cannot attack non-epic monsters.\n Monsters are not hurt nor do they become hostile by Ivern when he is equipped with an item that has the Immolate effect.\n In Nexus Blitz, Friend of the Forest will not affect monsters.
