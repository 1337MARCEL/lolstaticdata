Melee basic attacks that would trigger Spoils of War gain 150 bonus range and 30% bonus attack speed. Killing a minion by any means with a charge heals you and the nearest allied champion for 15- 90 (based on missing health) health and grants them kill gold. Healing is halved if the owner is ranged. These effects require an allied champion to be nearby."
