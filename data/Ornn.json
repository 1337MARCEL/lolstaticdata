This is however not true. Actives will always place their counterpart on cooldown, and passives are inconsistent: \n The  Heal and Shield Power from  Redemption and  Salvation stack, granting 20% when having them together.\n  The Black Cleaver and  The Obsidian Cleaver apply each 1 stack (for a total of 2) per instance of physical damage.\n The bonus on-hit damage from  Blade of the Ruined King and  Might of the Ruined King stacks. They however do not apply at the same time. The second on-hit will deal less damage because the target will have less current health because of the first on-hit.\n The auras of  Abyssal Mask and  Infernal Mask do not stack.\n The passive of  Infinity Edge and  Molten Edge do not stack.\n Both passives of  Youmuu's Ghostblade and  Youmuu's Wraithblade do not stack.\n The passive of  Rabadon's Deathcap and  Rabadon's Deathcrown do not stack, and Deathcap's passive will state that it grants 0 AP while using the item."
