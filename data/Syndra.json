However their duration will still get reset.\n A Dark Sphere summoned very shortly before Unleashed Power will be used as one of the spheres that get thrown. \n Depending on how many spheres are on the map and how far away the enemy is upon casting Unleashed Power it is possible that Syndra would conjure the sphere behind her as if she was going to throw it, but she won't.\n\n  Spell shield will only block the damage of a single sphere.\n Spheres are  knocked down upon  interception."
