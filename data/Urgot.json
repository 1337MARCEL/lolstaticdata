      "notes": "* Urgot can move while channeling and while executing his target.\n Reactivating the ability early will reel the target as soon as they reach the 25% maximum health threshold.\n The ability will reactivate and execute regardless of Urgot being crowd controlled or not, including self- or enemy-imposed  stasis.\n\n The second cast's chains are classified as projectile and can be stopped if:\n Urgot dies.\n The enemy becomes untargetable.\n The enemy is  CC-immune.\n\n  Spell shields will not block the chains.\n  Unstoppability, while preventing being dragged, does not remove the  suppression, which can last for longer than the usual execution time. Once the target inevitably loses their unstoppability, they are executed within 1.5 seconds. The target is untargetable for the whole duration of the suppression, even while unstoppable.\n When the chains start reeling in and suppressing a player's champion, chains will also cover the sides of their screen.\n The target will die regardless of their current health once the second cast's chains hit, even if they are healed by  Wish (which can affect untargetable allies) or have a shield that persists the duration of the channel that places them above the health threshold.\n If the target has  invulnerability that persists the duration of the channel, it will protect them from the execution - e.g.  Undying Rage, which can be activated during the suppression.\n The effect will also not prevent the activation of revival effects, such as  Guardian Angel or  Anivia's  Rebirth.\n Despite being untargetable,  Kalista can still  pull her Oathsworn out of the execution.\n Death-triggered passives ( Karthus'  Death Defied,  Kog'Maw's  Icathian Surprise, and  Sion's  Glory in Death) will be triggered.\n Only the target's current health will count as Urgot's damage in post-game statistics and spell vamp healing."
