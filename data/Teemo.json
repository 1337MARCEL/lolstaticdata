The mushroom will not become invulnerable and its detonation (if the teleportation is already  channeling when so) will not be canceled.\n  Spell shield will only block the  poison (self and allied) and the  slow but will not prevent the detonation itself.\n A thrown Noxious Trap will be destroyed when colliding with  Wind Wall /  Unbreakable."
