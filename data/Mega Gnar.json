As such, the 15 seconds that it lasts for can not be reduced by cooldown reduction or  cleansed.\n Gnar's abilities share cooldowns across forms.\n The final stats, after Rage Gene being applied, can be seen on Gnar and Mega Gnar respective data template, in the front page.\n Mini Gnar gains 5.5% \u2212 99% (based on level) bonus attack speed.\n Mega Gnar gains 100 \u2212 831 (based on level) base health, 3.5 \u2212 54.5 (based on level) base armor, 3.5 \u2212 63 (based on level) base magic resistance, and 6 \u2212 48.5 (based on level) base attack damage.",
