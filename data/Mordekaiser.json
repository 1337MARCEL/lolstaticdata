Targets will stop at the boundary even after it expired.\n\n Multiple Death Realms spawned will exist in the same dimension, allowing champions to see and interact with champions bound to other circles. Champions are only affected by their boundaries and are not able to see the others.\n  Tahm Kench's  Devour can carry a target outside of their circle, but they will be displaced back inside once  Regurgitated. \n An active  Assault and Battery on a target outside the perimeter will cause  Vi to continue her charge until her circle ends. She can knockback and damage secondary targets multiple times.\n\n The transition in and out of the Death Realm doesn't interrupt channels and doesn't affect the target's commands.

Ending the channel or cast time while inside another dimension will not do damage to nearby enemies.\n  Shuriken Flip may be re-cast inside the Death Realm even if its target is outside it, but  Akali will stop dashing upon colliding with the boundary.\n  Fear Beyond Death may not be re-cast while his victim is not in the same realm as him, but an already chained foe will still continue to be reeled in and executed. The  fear is cast in the realm Urgot is in.\n  Void Shift dispels from Realm of Death's slow, making it vulnerable to the Death Realm.\n  Ball will instantly return back to her if she's in another dimension.\n Controllable pets and decoys are still controllable between realms.\n\n PENDING FOR TEST:\n  Tahm Kench  Devours the target affected by Death Realm before it ends.\n\n The  nearsight from  Nocturne's  Paranoia does not affect a target\u2019s  sight radius while in the Death Realm.\n Unless Mordekaiser and  Nocturne are in the same dimension."
