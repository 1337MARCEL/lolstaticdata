She will gain her  Burrowed abilities (unusable), suffer from the self  nearsight, and activate Tremor Sense, but will not be  healed by  Fury of the Xer'Sai (unless  Burrowed prior to entering the Tunnel).\n If Rek'Sai enters a Tunnel while unburrowed, Rek'Sai will take longer to enter the tunnel because Rek'Sai will initiate the burrow animation before entering the tunnel. Rek'Sai will unburrow immediately after exiting the Tunnel, knocking up the nearest enemy and applying damage. This does not put  Burrow on cooldown.\n\n Rek'Sai can Tunnel through terrain if she dashes close to them and the wall is thin enough to allow the opposite entrance to spawn on the other side.\n Rek'Sai can be blocked from using a tunnel entrance if a ward is placed directly over it, because the cursor's target selection prioritizes wards over tunnel entrances."
