This is a visual bug, and his attack speed behaves normally.\n His reload speed is in the form of reloads per second:\n Graves' bonus attack speed growth and the cap affect his reload speed, making his bonus attack speed more worth after each level.\n Reload speed: Scales less the more attack speed you have until 150% bonus attack speed (not included growth). Going over that will decrease the reload speed until capping at 200% bonus attack speed.\n The  reload time after firing both shells and the time before reloading while sitting on one shell are the same, of 2.08 seconds. They're then reduced by bonus attack speed, to a minimum of 1.54 \u2212 1.12 (based on level) seconds.\n Reload speed at 150% bonus attack speed: 0.651 \u2212  0.891 (based on level).\n\n\n The reload time with one shell is 1.3 seconds.\n On-hit effects have a variety of interactions with New Destiny:\n Charge based on-hit effects like Energized or cooldown based on-hit effects like Spellblade will apply to the first target hit, and are not guaranteed to affect his attack target.\n On-Action Effects such as  Help, Pix! and  Runaan's Hurricane will be triggered, and still obey their standard target-acquisition rules. Wind's Fury can select secondary targets that are also damaged by Graves' attacks.\n  Guinsoo's Rageblade will affect all enemies hit, applying on-hit effects twice to each of them.\n  The Black Cleaver will apply 1 stack to the enemy each individual pellet hits, stacking multiple times if multiple pellets hit the same target.\n\n  Randuin's Omen's critical damage reduction will apply to every pellet.\n Given the right circumstances pellets can go around and beyond the intended target thus damaging other enemies.\n If Graves is  blinded pellets will fly (still in a cone) in a random direction (excluding his target's) but he can still damage nearby enemy units hit by pellets.\n\n Structures will intercept and be hit by multiple pellets, as with other valid targets.\n Units that take modified damage ( wards) can only be damaged by one pellet per attack and will not intercept additional ones."
