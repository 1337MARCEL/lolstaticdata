Eating the Frosted Snax causes the Poro King to unleash a barrage of 15 frosted artillery over the next 5 second upon a 1000-radius area, each dealing 213- 775 (based on level) magic damage to targets in the center of the impact, reduced to 85- 310 (based on level) on the edge (120 seconds cooldown).
