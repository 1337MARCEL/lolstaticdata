This takes 6 increments to reach the Total MS + 85, but may take more to reach the Uncapped Flat + 85. Due to flat bonuses increasing the time threshold, it is possible for the ability's effects to end before reaching the total uncapped movement speed. \n If Nunu turns continuously he will create a 600 unit circle, increased with bonus movement speed, striking the same point up to 3 times, for a maximum of 180 / 225 / 270 / 315 / 360 (+ 300% AP) magic damage.
