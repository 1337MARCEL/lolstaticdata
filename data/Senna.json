The fact that they're struck is considered basic attacked once by Senna was the reason damage came out.\n This may be confirmed by that the damage follows the rule of Ability Power damage conversion\n Also this implements that the damage is not as described in this skill, but is same with a basic attack to  Turrets from Senna.\n\n On-hit effects are applied in order of struck units' spawn ID. This matters for effects that are consumed on-hit (E.g.  Duskblade of Draktharr, Spellblade), which are applied to the target with the lowest Spawn ID.\n \"spawn ID\" is an unofficial abbreviation to describe the spawn order for all units at the beginning of games, below are some examples.\n If Senna targets an enemy champion but hits at least one more enemy champion simultaneously,  Press the Attack's first stack will be applied to that target. If no champion was targeted, it will default to the champion with the lowest Spawn ID out of the ones struck by the ability. Whether the effect stacks up on a champion or not when multiple enemy champions are stuck also depends on Spawn ID.\n IF Piercing Darkness struck an enemy champion and turret simultaneously, with  Rapid Firecannon fully charged,  Rapid Firecannon's effect will most likely proc on the turret since turrets are often spawned before champions."

For Senna, the appearance of being a wraith is a form-swap while camouflaged (similar to  Evelynn's  Demon Shade). Senna will remain in her wraith form when she is detected so long as the camouflage effect isn't broken, and her wraith's appearance is very distinct from other wraiths.\n\n  Oracle's Extract has no effect on champions with the Cloak of Mist buff, even though Oracle's Extract has a range of 500, while the camouflage radius is only 280 or 400 in the case of Senna herself."
