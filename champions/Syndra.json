The dead unit may still, however, be launched.\n Once upgraded to maximum rank Syndra gains a total damage increase of (20 + enemy's MR \u00f7 5)%.\n Enemy pets that passively have an effect on their surroundings will continue to affect the area around them while they are being held. For example,  Annie's  Tibbers will continue to inflict burn damage on surrounding units while in stasis.\n Grabbing a  Dark Sphere will cause the duration on it to refresh, but only on the first cast, not when it is thrown.\n Force of Will has additional effects when targeting the  Blue Sentinel and  Red Brambleback. Throwing the former will refund 10 mana to Syndra upon cast and will reduce the  Cooldown of Force of Will by 1 second, while throwing the latter will apply the  Crest of Cinders burn to any affected units in the area of effect.",

She can walk away as soon as the casting has completed, as the spheres only begin dealing their damage after the casting time.\n Each one of the sphere hits is considered a  single target spell, triggering  Muramana each time.\n Casting Unleashed Power on a target that becomes  untargetable while the spheres are in flight will cause all spheres to deal no damage and be destroyed.\n Spheres already in flight will still travel if Syndra's target dies, but any remaining sphere will not. However their duration will still get reset.\n A Dark Sphere summoned very shortly before Unleashed Power will be used as one of the spheres that get thrown. \n Depending on how many spheres are on the map and how far away the enemy is upon casting Unleashed Power it is possible that Syndra would conjure the sphere behind her as if she was going to throw it, but she won't.\n\n  Spell shield will only block the damage of a single sphere.",
